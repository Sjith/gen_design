Generates random numbers. Each time the random()
function is called, it returns an unexpected value 
within the specified range. If only one parameter 
is passed to the function, it will return a float 
between zero and the value of the high parameter. 
For example, random(5) returns values between 0 
and 5 (starting at zero, and up to, but not including, 5).
